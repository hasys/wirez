- Demo goal
***********

    - Mini-pallette work

    - Check full authoring workflows

    - Sequence flows stuff
        - Let unconnected
        - Drop from palette
        - Un-connect & reconnect head/tail
        - command undo's
        
    - Lienzo stuff
            
- Lienzo
********

    - Fix wires issues
        - WiresLayoutContainer - set positions when resizing
        - WiresManager - addToIndex not working for unconnected connectors
        - WiresShapeDragHandler -> fixes on highlight / un-highlight
        - Examples
            - Resize -> http://screencast.com/t/TjRkYpMvt
            - Align -> http://screencast.com/t/62lCjZGYDq7i
        - Events
            - More events and provide the natives...
            - Drag event -> cannot get the DragContext
            - In general -> return the handler registration as well in order to remove handlers when no necessary.

    - Shape order ( flows, parent/child nodes, etc )
    - review wires containment. 
        - Eg: lanes -> if dragging lane title inside the lane, the lane gets removed from the parent diagram and then it sometimes gets on top and nothing can be moved inside it.
        - dragging children shapes crashed with docking... ( toolbox )
        
    - Wires refactors
        - Exctract logics for containment & connection ( highlight parents, show magnets, etc) from drag event handlers
        
    - Others
        - Text orientation

- Client
*********

    - General
        - Help widgets & tooltips/popovers
        - Error handling
        - refactor use of CDI qualifiers ( managers & services ) -> CDI @Priority 
        - Show/Hide grid toolbar button
        
    - Usability
        - dragging constrained just for diagram bounds?

    - Controls
        - Toolbox
            - Fixings
            - Icon titles/tooltips
        - SelectionControl
            - Select multiple
            - Fire canvas selected method

    - Load diagram screen
        - Pagination

    - Notifcations widget
        - Design
        - Pagination
        - Row colors ( different notification types )
        
    - Canvas Toolbar    
        - Toolbar undo & clearSelection should be initially disabled

- API
*****

    - Split API/client module - extract impls?

    - model
        - Definition Impls -> finish implementation & generate from ifaces and the adapter as well
        - Performance
            - private constructors
            - review inmutability (final fields) -> bindable needs pub no-arg const! How 2 deal with finals?
            - if making fields static -> marhsalls as null... ( eg: DefSet#labels )
            - builders
                - mark as @NonPortable
                - auto generate when using annotated models?
        - avoid @Portable and @Bindable and generate the Errai.properties for the annotated pojos.
        
    - Graph Processors - declare as @Remote ifaces

    - Commands
        - UNDO's
            - ClearGraph
            - SetConnectionSourceNodeCommand
            - SetConnectionTargetNodeCommand
        - Fix -> both SetConnectionSourceNodeCommand/Target commands are checking rules using same arguments...
        - ensure only single parent/edge connections between nodes
         - CommManager
            - executions async ( use of Caller's ) - use callbacks as expensive ops can be executed on backend asynchronously
        - Restore the graph to a previous state
        - REDO's

    - Look-ups
        - Add cache
        - Use Caller's on client side
        - Use Dashbuilder's DataSets?
        
Annotation processors
*********************

    - Check that each annotation is present on expected domain model class

Backend
*******

    - Missing diagram services ( such as delete )
        - diagrams sync / commands sync between client & tenant managers on server side

Import tool
************

  - refactor to current API
  - typesafe velocity templates? 
  - TemplateResult 
    - add skipped results ( pojos + message )
  - generated files indentation

Performance
***********

    - Global
        - Heap, cpu & timeline performance checks
        
    - Controls 
        - Check disable() 
        - Check de-registrations ( handlers, etc )
    
    - Session widgets
        - Checks session events are handled as expected
        
    - TreeExplorer 
        - redraw only updated element & children, if any.

    - Load diagram
        - Slow - Heap & cpu performance check

    - Custom Map impl for storing DefSet stuff ( valid to use on bindable adapters, indexes, etc )
    
House keeping & others
**********************
    
    - recompiling canvas controls forces to restart server always? ( csadilek )
    - Unit testing
    - Distros
        - remove beans.xml exclusion for org.wirez.client... should not be there. 
    - Remove GraphBoundsIndexBuilder and use Layer#findShapeAt ( check Builder control & GraphBoundsIndexer & LienzoLayerUtils )
    - BPMN marshalling / unmarshalling
        - Remove code from "legacy" package and use the jbpm-designer-backend artifact as a required dependency.
            - Exclude drools datamodeller transitive artifact -> It produces an errai compilation error
            - Try to exclude as much as possible the transitive dependencies
            - Currently some CDI issues appears when adding it...
     - Connections
        - Do not call head/tailConnectionAccepted until drag eng!
    - Generics cleaning ( commands, etc )
    - i18n
